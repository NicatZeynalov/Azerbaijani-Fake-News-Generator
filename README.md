# Azerbaijani Fake News Generator
The aim of this project is to generate fake news in the Azerbaijani language using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks are powerful Deep Learning models which are used for learning sequenced data. Here a LSTM model is trained on 100 thousand samples, and it should be able to generate text. Data for the training has been scraped from the most popular news website of Azerbaijan. Model accuracy is about 70% over the 50 epochs.

NB! I have shared only a small piece of sample data.
